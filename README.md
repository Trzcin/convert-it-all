# Convert It All

A set of utilities allowing for conversions between file formats. It supports primarly multimedia and text based formats.

This repository contains two subprojects:

- `cli` - a bash script capable of converting files in an interactive way
- `web` - a website allowing for uploading and downloading converted files. The files are processed on the users machine and are not sent to any remote server.

Head over to their respective directories to learn more about each one.
